# QTPyFlashUtility

This repo contains code for flashing the QT Py SAMD21 Board with a precompiled code. 

This will serve for now as a means for SMC/SNU to flash the QT Py with code to read the PMS5003 or OPC-R2. Eventually, this will be used as a basis for a more mature program for them to use with the Mannequin project.
